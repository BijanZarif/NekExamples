This is a simple example illustrating flow past a cylinder in 2D.

A unit-diameter cylinder is centered at (0,0) in a box on [-15,35] x [-15,15].

With unit inflow velocity at x=-15, the Reynolds number is given by

  Re = 1/viscosity

For the current case, we have Re=100, which can be specified in the
.rea file either by setting parameter 2, p2=.01 (the viscosity) or 
p2=-100.  If Nek5000 sees a negative value for parameter 2 it sets
viscosity to the reciprocal, viscosity = 1/|p2|.

The mesh was built by combining a file box.rea generated with genbox, 
using the input file fpcyl.box, with a second file, import.rea, which
contains the cylinder definition.  This file was generated with prenek.

If you wish to change the farfield resolution, you can edit fpcyl.box,
rerun genbox, and then merge box.rea with import.rea.

This case has a relatively fine spectral element mesh and should give
reasonable results for lx1=6 (polynomial order N=5).

There is a simple ad-hoc Strouhal number estimator put into the .usr
file -- it has not been extensively tested, so no guarantees.
