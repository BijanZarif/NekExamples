These cases provide examples of the convecting cone problem illustrated 
in Gottlieb & Orszg (1972) and Deville, Fischer, & Mund (2002).

Typically, to run them you would change SIZE such that the product
lx1*E1 = 32, where the total number of elements in the given case
is E=E1*E1.   For cone016 we have E=16 and E1=4, etc.  Thus, set lx1
as follows:

    cone256    lx1=2   
    cone064    lx1=4   
    cone016    lx1=8
